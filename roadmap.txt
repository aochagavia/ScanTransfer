Stage 0 (done)
==============

Node.js server for signaling
Assumption: only one receiver and one sender at the same time
(things will probably break if multiple windows are open)

Stage 1 (done)
==============

Give senders and receivers an id
Match senders and receivers from a different tab

Stage 2 (done)
==============

Display a QR code on the sender and receiver tab
Scan a QR code on the match tab. Send the resulting match

Stage 3 (done)
==============

Allow specifying a file to the sender
Send that file upon matching

Stage 4 (done)
==============

Remove the distinction between sender and receiver
Use matching to establish a connection

Stage 5 (todo)
==============

Design:
* Clearly show the status of the connection
* Drag and drop files, send automatically
* Show a list of received files
